# Reddit Daily Programmer

This is my collection of code solutions to Reddit's r/DailyProgrammer subreddit. I have intentionally left some solutions unfinished to document the progression of my thought process. When possible, I've included a flowchart of the initial path to work through the solution. It may not describe the final execution path of the code, but is another way I tried to document my thought process.


The folder name format is XXXY where XXX stands for the challenge number and Y is the difficulty level of the challenge (E for Easy, I for Intermediate, and H for Hard).

I compiled the code with the Java 9 build 181 compiler. Solutions I've so far developed with clickable links to their problem descriptions in reddit (including unfinished ones) are as follows:

- [335 Easy](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/759fha/20171009_challenge_335_easy_consecutive_distance/) - Consecutive Distance Rating (unfinished)
- [338 Easy](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/79npf9/20171030_challenge_338_easy_what_day_was_it_again/) - Day Of Week: Done without Java 8's time API. Did the calculation in two different ways. One using a year iterator and another with just the months.
- [340 Easy](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/7cnqtw/20171113_challenge_340_easy_first_recurring/) - First Recurring Character
- [341 Easy](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/7eh6k8/20171121_challenge_341_easy_repeating_numbers/) - Repeating numbers in a number sequence. (unfinished) Got discouraged at this point and took a break to solve Project Euler problems to sharpen my thinking.
- [344 Easy](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/7j33iv/20171211_challenge_344_easy_baumsweet_sequence/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=hot&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=dailyprogrammer) - Baum Sweet Sequence. First time using Java 8 streams. Fastest I've got to a solution!
